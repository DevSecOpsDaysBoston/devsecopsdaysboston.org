    <h2>DevOps in #CivicTech</h2>
    <p>
      <p>This talk will center around how the US Government has been on a DevOps journey
and where various agencies are from civilian agencies to the defense department
and all the way to the White House!</p>

<p>My name is Ken Kato and I’m a White House Presidential Innovation Fellow or
PIF since the government loves acronyms. As a PIF we’re detailed to a specific
agency, in my case I’m detailed to the Department of the Navy. Previous to being
a PIF, I helped launch USAF Kessel Run right here in Boston. I went through my
own DevOps journey once upon a time, circa 2006 when I learned puppet as a
means to open up more time for me and my team to do valuable things over
hand-holding every darn switch and router. Since then I’ve continued half in
ops and half in dev into cloudy things. Today I apply my experience to bettering
our government as a PIF. I have a unique opportunity to speak truth to power,
and just #GetShipDone. One of the things I accomplished year one was launching
a cloud-native platform for the Navy and like to talk to you all about how we got there.</p>
