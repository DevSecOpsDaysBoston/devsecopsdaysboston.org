 involvement by engineers from sponsors rather over sales pitches and junk email spam.

# Our Commitment to Attendee Privacy and Value

We do not sell attendee emails or provide their demographic information. Under no circumstances
 does this event provide these details in exchange for sponsorship money. Premiere sponsorship income
 is devoted to paying for event resources and ensuring the future of this conference.

If you are looking for leads, this is not the event for you. Organization who have
 an ethical understanding that leads are not the only reason to invest in community events
 and that they also have a responsibility to drive meaningful interactions, then we encourage
 you to sponsor this event! Otherwise, there are many other pay-to-play events out there.

# Call for Proposals

{% if site.cfp.is_open %}

Our CFP for {{ site.event_short_title }} opened on {{ site.cfp.open_date }} and will close on {{ site.cfp.close_date }}. Our organizers will be finalizing acceptances by {{ site.schedule.announce_date}}.

Experts from your organization may submit proposals to our CFP, however speaking spots are NEVER exchanged for money so your sponsorship
does not assure that submissions will be accepted. We focus on the most meaningful presentations for our attendees, not pay-to-plays.

{% else %}

Our CFP for {{ site.event_short_title }} closed {{ site.cfp.close_date }}, and our organizers are finalizing acceptances by {{ site.schedule.announce_date}}.

However, due to the overwhelming response for CFPs this year, the organizers are
 considering a more continuous program of smaller events (e.g. meetups, etc.)
 where these and future submissions would make sense to schedule.

The best thing to do for now is to sponsor {{ site.event_short_title }} on {{ site.current_event.dates }} and join our
 community for some great conversations and connections!

# Premiere Sponsorship Details

Aside from the above perks, organizers also welcome discussion on the following virtual-friendly options:

- Hands-on booth setup assistance with an organizer and tailoring capabilities available before the event
- Collaboration and synchronization of social media shares related to the conference sponsorship
- Activity planning for the "20min booth swarming event"*

***NOTE:*** "Booth Swarm": between stage presentations, the conference will encourage all attendees to "swarm" your booth for a short period of time once during the event. Organizers highly recommend that you have more than 4 people from your company/organization actively involved in the booth at that time, either doing demos, handling breakout topic conversations, and working it hard in the chat. Many virtual conferences in 2020 suffered from a lack of virtual engagement plan such as those that exist for physical events. {{ site.event_short_title }} organizers have decided on "swarming" as a unique way to make sure that premiere sponsors and conference attendees engage meaningfully at least once during the conference.

# Contributor Sponsorship Details

In keeping with the spirit and values of the conference, sponsors who donate a minimum total of $2,000 USD to one or more organizer-approved charities and causes also receive a subset of perks. This option encourages for-profit organizations to directly and positively support underrepresented communities.

Suggested Donation Beneficiaries:

{% include good-cause-list.html %}

If you have alternative non-profit charities or causes you would like to suggest, please ask the organizers to review and approve it for inclusion into this list BEFORE donating. Donations that occur before engaging the event organizers cannot be retroactively counted towards a sponsorship since the event is encouraging net-new donation revenue.
Questions?

All questions can be emailed to [{{ site.email }}](/contact) and depending on the nature of the question, organizers can be scheduled for a brief face-to-face virtual chat upon request.
