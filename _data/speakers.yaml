  title: "KEYNOTE: The Future of Cloud-Native Security"
  abstract: |
    In recent years, we have witnessed an explosive uptick in cloud-native security
    implementations for their myriad of benefits. As modern development processes
    speed up, organizations have recognized the urgent need for integrated security.

    In this talk, Caroline will share her observations on how companies must change
    the way they build security into their cloud-native projects, and forecast
    what’s next for cloud-native security. She will discuss how, when it comes
    to the future of cloud-native security, organizations must double down on
    people and process innovation to overcome the misconceptions, education gaps
    and common mistakes we see when it comes to the cloud.

    Cloud native is here; it is scaling, and it is not going anywhere. The more
    we can see the reality and necessity of what security must become, the better
    we will all be in the long run.

  title: "Integrating DevSecOps Teams"
  abstract: |
    When working with DevSecOps, the biggest challenge may be how to integrate
    security into Dev and Ops functions. Traditional teams understand development
    and operations but bringing the department of "No" in compliance security
    for highly-regulated industries can be more difficult. This session discusses
    some experience about building the basic discussions into your teams when
    integrating security practices. Starts with explaining the cyber threat landscape
    faced by today's businesses and then expands to suggest ways to better integrate
    your security team while facing modern challenges.
    Uses current examples of transformation from both sides to emphasize understanding.
    Offers a clear framework to guide the discussion between dev, sec, and ops teams
    to build common ground and deliver value to the customer.

  title: "The Vulnerability Deluge: How to Dig In"
  abstract: |
    DevSecOps is here to stay—the next iteration in the Agile development, rapid
    feedback evolution we’re witnessing in software development today. Security
    is a critical element in this equation. An element that cannot be neglected.

    As we’re bearing witness to a dynamically challenging environment, and now
    with remote work becoming a widespread and ongoing reality, heightened security
    awareness is not only an optional course to be completed for additional credits,
    but rather it is a non-negotiable requirement to be taken seriously. Companies
    expect their developers to provide high-quality, secure code quickly; however,
    with reduced development timelines and limited resources, the approach around
    such expectations needs to evolve with the development landscape.

    Development teams are looking for help in adapting to these changes. Organizations
    need guidance in how best to check and validate secure code quickly. Organizations
    are also looking for the most efficient and effective means to ramp up development
    velocity as urgency in demand continues to escalate. Automation is the key.
    But the question of ‘how’ organizations can bring that to life based on size
    of operations, development maturity and ramping urgency  are the fundamental
    aspects of what defines the organizational culture of DevSecOps.

    Within this presentation, I will explore strategies in which organizations
    with varying needs and goals can achieve DevSecOps successfully. While sometimes
    organizational expectations exceed what is currently available in the market,
    I will also be sharing real-world examples of how organizational expectations
    were met with out-of-the-box solutions based on my first-hand experience with
    customers. I will also share common implementation pitfalls that organizations
    often encounter at the beginning of their DevSecOps journey.

    While I do intent to discuss specific tooling solutions within this presentation,
    I will not be endorsing any specifically. Rather, this will be an unbiased
    examination of various technologies and the value they may offer when implementing
    a DevSecOps approach.

  title: "How We Automated Ourselves Out of On-Call Burnout...and you can too!"
  abstract: |
    The repetitive nature of response tasks is one of the biggest causes of
    fatigue and burnout among Incident Responders. Anyone who’s been on-call on
    a Security team can remember how many hours they’ve spent opening the same
    tabs, clicking the same buttons, copy+pasting the same indicator data, and
    performing other similar tasks repeatedly. Imagine if that time was spent
    building stronger detection capabilities instead, or even better, on taking
    a break from the screen and going out for a walk!

    While this can be solved by outsourcing the frontline response capabilities,
    it can be costly in terms of time and money to identify a proficient vendor,
    obtain approvals, finalize the contract, as well as the financial cost of
    the service...

    What if I told you that at Segment we built this capability with an
    open-source tool in the same amount of time it would take a team to do all
    of the above with the time and resources of a single full-time security
    engineer? Welcome to the story of our Response Automation journey!

    This talk will center around how the US Government has been on a DevOps journey
    and where various agencies are from civilian agencies to the defense department
    and all the way to the White House!

    My name is Ken Kato and I’m a White House Presidential Innovation Fellow or
    PIF since the government loves acronyms. As a PIF we’re detailed to a specific
    agency, in my case I’m detailed to the Department of the Navy. Previous to being
    a PIF, I helped launch USAF Kessel Run right here in Boston. I went through my
    own DevOps journey once upon a time, circa 2006 when I learned puppet as a
    means to open up more time for me and my team to do valuable things over
    hand-holding every darn switch and router. Since then I’ve continued half in
    ops and half in dev into cloudy things. Today I apply my experience to bettering
    our government as a PIF. I have a unique opportunity to speak truth to power,
    and just #GetShipDone. One of the things I accomplished year one was launching
    a cloud-native platform for the Navy and like to talk to you all about how we got there.

  title: "Server Side Request Forgery in AWS and why only IMDSv2 is not enough"
  abstract: |
    One of the defense in depth solutions against SSRF on applications running
    on the AWS cloud is to upgrade to IMDSv2. The idea is that if a token is
    required as part of the header, an attacker cannot invoke the instance metadata
    endpoint using the SSRF. However, there are caveats.

    In this talk we will see what you can achieve with SSRF attacks, how IMDSv2
    prevents vanilla SSRFs from accessing the instance metadata and what scenarios
    exist in the real world where IMDSv2 can attacked to extract AWS EC2 metadata
    including keys to the kingdom (fancy phrase for overly privileged IAM instance
    role credentials) to compromise the entire AWS cloud platform on which the app
    or service is running.

    We will look at a popular npm package that can cause your environment to become
    vulnerable when it's deployed. We will end the talk with some tips on how we could
    still be safe while not trusting the protection that IMDSv2 offers.

  title: "Adding Security to your SLO-based Release Validation with Keptn"
  abstract: |
    Automatic Release Validation, aka Quality Gates, is not a new concept but
    often only covers functional or performance metrics. Keptn’s open SLO-based
    evaluation allows DevSecOps to have their favorite security tool report SLOs
    such as number of detected vulnerabilities as part of delivery automation.

    This session will focus on the concept of SLO-based release validation with
    the CNCF project Keptn. Attendees will learn how they can bring in their own
    security tool and connect it to Keptn via an SLI-Provider. Examples would be
    open source tools such as Falco or commercial security tools of choice.

    The goal is to educate DevSecOps on the opportunity to automatically detect
    security related problems as part of delivery automation.

  title: "Scaling Security Controls with SLIM – Stakeholder Life Cycle Model"
  abstract: |
    DevSecOps often implements shift left by automating security checks into the
    delivery pipeline. As security threats are not constrained to CI/CD we introduce
    SLIM. SLIM advocates for zero touch continuous security, enabling stakeholders
    to manage security for the entire lifecycle of their assets.

    This session is based on a research paper currently under review titled
    “SLIM – Efficiently Scaling Security Controls using a Stakeholder Life Cycle Model”.
    SLIM discusses a new approach to systematically identify barriers to automation
    and scaling of security controls, increase coverage and with that reduce MTTD
    (Mean Time to Detect) and MTTR (Mean Time to Report). SLIM advocates for automated
    lifecycle management of assets (artifacts, configurations, …) where stakeholders
    can onboard and offboard their assets to a continuous zero touch security process
    without having to learn or deal with individual security tools on a day2day basis.
