  title: "KEYNOTE: The Future of Cloud-Native Security"
  abstract: |
    In recent years, we have witnessed an explosive uptick in cloud-native security
    implementations for their myriad of benefits. As modern development processes
    speed up, organizations have recognized the urgent need for integrated security.

    In this talk, Caroline will share her observations on how companies must change
    the way they build security into their cloud-native projects, and forecast
    what’s next for cloud-native security. She will discuss how, when it comes
    to the future of cloud-native security, organizations must double down on
    people and process innovation to overcome the misconceptions, education gaps
    and common mistakes we see when it comes to the cloud.

    Cloud native is here; it is scaling, and it is not going anywhere. The more
    we can see the reality and necessity of what security must become, the better
    we will all be in the long run.

  title: "Integrating DevSecOps Teams"
  abstract: |
    When working with DevSecOps, the biggest challenge may be how to integrate
    security into Dev and Ops functions. Traditional teams understand development
    and operations but bringing the department of "No" in compliance security
    for highly-regulated industries can be more difficult. This session discusses
    some experience about building the basic discussions into your teams when
    integrating security practices. Starts with explaining the cyber threat landscape
    faced by today's businesses and then expands to suggest ways to better integrate
    your security team while facing modern challenges.
    Uses current examples of transformation from both sides to emphasize understanding.
    Offers a clear framework to guide the discussion between dev, sec, and ops teams
    to build common ground and deliver value to the customer.

  title: "The Vulnerability Deluge: How to Dig In"
  abstract: |
    DevSecOps is here to stay—the next iteration in the Agile development, rapid
    feedback evolution we’re witnessing in software development today. Security
    is a critical element in this equation. An element that cannot be neglected.

    As we’re bearing witness to a dynamically challenging environment, and now
    with remote work becoming a widespread and ongoing reality, heightened security
    awareness is not only an optional course to be completed for additional credits,
    but rather it is a non-negotiable requirement to be taken seriously. Companies
    expect their developers to provide high-quality, secure code quickly; however,
    with reduced development timelines and limited resources, the approach around
    such expectations needs to evolve with the development landscape.

    Development teams are looking for help in adapting to these changes. Organizations
    need guidance in how best to check and validate secure code quickly. Organizations
    are also looking for the most efficient and effective means to ramp up development
    velocity as urgency in demand continues to escalate. Automation is the key.
    But the question of ‘how’ organizations can bring that to life based on size
    of operations, development maturity and ramping urgency  are the fundamental
    aspects of what defines the organizational culture of DevSecOps.

    Within this presentation, I will explore strategies in which organizations
    with varying needs and goals can achieve DevSecOps successfully. While sometimes
    organizational expectations exceed what is currently available in the market,
    I will also be sharing real-world examples of how organizational expectations
    were met with out-of-the-box solutions based on my first-hand experience with
    customers. I will also share common implementation pitfalls that organizations
    often encounter at the beginning of their DevSecOps journey.

    While I do intent to discuss specific tooling solutions within this presentation,
    I will not be endorsing any specifically. Rather, this will be an unbiased
    examination of various technologies and the value they may offer when implementing
    a DevSecOps approach.

    Remember the opening scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark?  Or finding the Temple of Doom?
    Finding the grail in the Last Crusade?  There are some fun principles and parallels that a
    pply to application security in those movies.  So come take a look at what
    Indiana Jones can teach us about appsec.

    This will be a fun discussion using classic Indiana Jones movie segments and
    correlating to application security needs and practices. The main idea showing
    how application security plays a big role in building that trust and confidence
    for your clients.

    We invite you to join us on this quest to drive trust and confidence for those
    customers that are looking at how you handle their data and the methods you
    use to protect it, because they expect you to handle it responsibly.

  title: "How We Automated Ourselves Out of On-Call Burnout...and you can too!"
  abstract: |
    The repetitive nature of response tasks is one of the biggest causes of
    fatigue and burnout among Incident Responders. Anyone who’s been on-call on
    a Security team can remember how many hours they’ve spent opening the same
    tabs, clicking the same buttons, copy+pasting the same indicator data, and
    performing other similar tasks repeatedly. Imagine if that time was spent
    building stronger detection capabilities instead, or even better, on taking
    a break from the screen and going out for a walk!

    While this can be solved by outsourcing the frontline response capabilities,
    it can be costly in terms of time and money to identify a proficient vendor,
    obtain approvals, finalize the contract, as well as the financial cost of
    the service...

    What if I told you that at Segment we built this capability with an
    open-source tool in the same amount of time it would take a team to do all
    of the above with the time and resources of a single full-time security
    engineer? Welcome to the story of our Response Automation journey!
